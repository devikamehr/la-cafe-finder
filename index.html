            <h3> What's this?</h3>
            <p>
                If you're like me, you've noticed that some of your 
                favorite artists name drop different 
                eateries and cafes in their songs. Did they go there 
                for inspiration? Are they a regular?
                This small website helps you locate yummy spots your 
                favorite artists have used in their music. 
                Focused primarily on the popular influencer city, LA! 
                Hopefully, more to come soon :)

                Don't fret! You can just click here and start browsing. 
                This is totally free and I've used resources from here. 
                I'm still listening for new destinations !

                What artists did you use? 
            </h3>
            <p> 
                As I did use many online websites to help with this, I've
                also curated a spotify playlist for you to use while you browse.
                Who knows- maybe while you're listening to the artist's music, 
                they'll walk right by you! Tell them I sent you :)
